a friend who want to track friend's location.

will be open and it ask for some permission after these permission two marker will be shown on map and there will
be a button "start tracking" which when second user press the trcking will start.
the remaining distance and speed will be shown on top of screen and as user make movement towards friends location (which he received via link)
